# Greedy Algorithms 

## Overview

Today, Let's cover the greedy algorithms. More specifically a few popular greedy algorithms.

------------------------------------
Greedy approach is all about short term benefits. In more academic terms :

> Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. Greedy algorithms are used for optimization problems. An optimization problem can be solved using Greedy if the problem has the following property: At every step, we can make a choice that looks best at the moment, and we get the optimal solution of the complete problem.

Now just because it gives immediate benefits does'nt mean that it is always good. Why? ðŸ¤” 

Because sometimes greedy algorithm is unable to find the global maximum of the problem which makes sense, as NP-Hard Problems like Travelling Salesman Problem has convergence issues sometimes.


## Problems :

Hmm... So, enough of the theory. Lets pull ourselves on the Problems and try to think of the solutions for some of the solution:
